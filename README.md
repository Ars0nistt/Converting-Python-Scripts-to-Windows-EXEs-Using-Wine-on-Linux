Please click on method.yml on the main repository page to see the first and only commit thus far: comprehensive instructions on how to convert Python scripts to .exe Windows executable files using the compatibility layer Wine in a Linux environment. Testd and working as of Friday, October 17, 2025. Please note that I am using Nobara and so the instructions are written using Fedora-based command line prompts, but they are easy to swap in and out for commands specific to your chosen Linux distribution.

One thing to note that I forgot to include in the actual guide: the Python install commands found in the guide are specifically for systems running AMD processors. If you have a different CPU, the download page on the Python website should recognize that and give you the correct download file, but you may need to tweak the command accordingly.
