Please click on method.yml on the main repository page to see the first and only commit thus far: comprehensive instructions on how to convert Python scripts to .exe Windows executable files using the compatibility layer Wine in a Linux environment. Testd and working as of Friday, October 17, 2025. Please note that I am using Nobara and so the instructions are written using Fedora-based command line prompts, but they are easy to swap in and out for commands specific to your chosen Linux distribution.
